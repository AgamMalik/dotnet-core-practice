> all the public methods of a controller class are called actions.
	-we define a route for each action using attribute routing [Route(here definr route pattern)]...eg [Route("Home")]
		-it is coming from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc namespace

> add services before calling build method....(builder.Service.xyzService)...(builder.Service.AddTransient<ControllerNAme>)
	-a service is basically a reusable class to perform certain tasks which can be reused in applicatons without having direct relationship with the UI.
	-controllers are also treated as services.
	-we also need to import the namespace of the controller in main class.

	-and a shortcut or better way of doing all this is using AddControllers() method......
	-builder.Service.AddController().
	-.net will automatically add all the controllers in main file (by detecting Controller suffix in controller name.)
	-use MapControllers() function in endpoint..it will automnatically map all the endpoints
		-endpoint.MapControllers()
	- we can even simply just use app.MapControllers()...it will do the same...with userouting and endpoint type work.



.......... dowloading files..........................
> virtualFileResult ---> for files present in webroot directory(wwwroot) only.

> physicalFileResult  ---> if the file is present outside project

> FileContentResult  ----> if we have the file conetnt as bytearray byte[]





> RedirectToAction  ---> to redirect from a url to another url (old url to new url)
